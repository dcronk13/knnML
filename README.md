# knnML
The point of this project was to implement a k nearest neighbor algorithm using Python. Throughout this assignment I learned how to implement knn on a training set and how to apply and predict on a test dataset. Also learned how to perform 4 fold cross validation and how to change the value of k to return the best results.
